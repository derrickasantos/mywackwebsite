        <h2><b>About My Family</b></h2>
        <p>My family is very, very big. The oldest is my grandmother Ana Maria;
        she is very loud and mean but she loves me. Next is my step-father, Birol. 
        We don't really talk so he doesn't matter. After comes my mother, Jeymy Maireny.
        She talks a lot and makes okay food. Derrick, my brother, follows. He is dumb 
        and doesn't know he's adopted. I'm next. The best in the family. Sophia and Camilla
        are last. In my family, we tend to group them together since they are almost in 
        the same age range (Sophia is 6 while Camila is 5) but they are very different 
        from each other. They are almost complete opposites. This is my family.</p>
